A good old tic tac toe game with a couple useful buttons and features added:
- reset score
- reset board
- add a custom username
- notifying if there was a win or a draw

The main takeaways from this project:
- desinging custom classes that suit the project and implementing them
- becoming more efficient when working with documentation
